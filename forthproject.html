Currently, professional social networking sites such as LinkedIn don't facilitate conversations. FollowUp brings students and professionals together in person, so the students can better find opportunities for professional development. </p>

                        <q> I liked to talking to the professionals because I got to see what they are like. </q> 
                        <p> The general feeling we found from conducting user interviews with students was that their online connections were not nearly benefiting the to the extent they would like. Students want to talk to recruiters and professionals, but aren't reaching out for a variety of reasons. </p>

                        <p class="midsection__description"> We condensed the main concerns gathered from our user interviews and online research onto individual post it notes. We then did a group exercsise in which we grouped concerns and labaled these groups. We identified three main groups or problems: </p>

                            <p> One of the most pominent problems we found, based on its prevalence, and its reach into other categories, was the lack of a personal connection. Students felt that their conversations with recruiters were brief and shallow. </p>

                        <li>

                            <p> What we found through online research, was that reruiters often wanted to find make a connection with potential appplicants, but were short on time. </p>

                        <li>

                            <p> There was a lot of social anxiety on the student's part involved in talking to a recruiter. Students often felt like they were lacking in experience and that they were just one in a applicant of many in the process. </p>

                    <p> We combined our ideas and came up with a rough first draft, an app that was similar to Happn, the dating app where users would get matched based on their proximity, but with students and recruiters instead. We would then suggest students and recruiters to meet up. </p> 
                    <p> But, we realized that this app was too focused on job seeking rather than building a network, so we scrapped the idea. </p>

                        <p class="midsection__description"> Our second draft also centered around matching around user-specified information that the recruiter would approve in order to combat the social barriers that arise from students feeling like they aren't what the recruiters are looking for. We tried to make the communication between the recruiter and student more personal by including a video call feature, but after conduct user testing, we found that users were still reluctant to reach out to recruiters. Students never met these people before. It was very intimidating for students to engage in a video call with someone you don't know. </p>

                        <p class="midsection__description"> AFter revisting our problem space, we focused back on connections that we've already made once before from career fairs, mixers, etc. We wanted to make these connections meaningful by having users keep in contact and develop a relationship with each other. We decided to make an app based on the Dining With Professors program at UCSD. The Dining With Profesors program allows students to network and get to know their professors over a meal. We felt that the most personal connection you can get is meeting with someone in person, so created FollowUp, an app that allows you to import your LinkedIn connections and request meetups with those connections in order to develop a more meaningful connection. </p>

                        <p class="midsection__description"> One of our team members created a high-fidelity prototype based on on our paper prototype. We then proceeded to get feecback from our friends and other designers. Based on the feedback we recevied, we improved the app by making areas of our app, particularly the news feed where we can see our friend's FollowUps, more personal, in addition to some stylistic and small user-experience improvements.</p>

                        <p class="subsection__description"> In this first draft, we created a feed. We made the decision to include a feed based on a reserach study conducted on Facebook with voting. This study showed that people on Facebook are more likely to vote if they see that their friends are votign. But for this first draft, the feed only provided information on who was following up with who. We made the feed more personal and effective at encrouraging users to participate by allowing the users to post pictures of their FollowUp and add some description of their experiences. </p>

                <p class="section__description"> Something that was particularly challenging about this project was staying focused our goal. There were different interpretations of our goal held by our team members. For exmaple, my teammates understood the problem of being personal as showcasing personalities and personality-based matching, but while similar, I understood it more as conversations should feel more directed towards a pariticular person rather than a general conversation. In the future, I would establish and solidify a clear goal with everyone else on the team before proceeding with the project. </p> 
                <p class="section__description"> Another thought for the future of FollowUp regards incentives on the professional side. We mostly focused on the students' side of networking, but in order for FollowUp to really become sucessful in the real world, we would need to interview and gather more information from the professionals' point of view. There are a lot of clear incentives for the student, but there weren't many clear incentives for professionals aide from helping out their community or free food. </p>
