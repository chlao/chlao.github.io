                        <p class="subsection__description"> These are the final images that we decided to use for the website. We got rid of the unclear abstraction of uploading photos, and older usb connection way of uploading, and replaced it with a more modern approach of uploading, i.e. to the cloud. CardKive is aimed at younger people, so this kind of graphic is more current and trendy. And the last graphic makes it clear, that CardKive can be used on both desktops and your mobile devices, while previous drafts of the design only represented a phone. This was a result of a misunderstanding of the product and where the founders of CardKive wanted to go with it. I was under the impression that CardKive was focused on the mobile application rather than the desktop, but they really wanted it to be accessible to people everywhere, since memories happen everywhere. </p> 
                        <p class="subsection__description"> Another aspect of the design includes the "gradient" effect from the first step to the last. Aside from the numbering, we wanted the steps to be clear, so there's a subtle gradient effect applied to the pictures where the first picture is lighter than the next, and so on. </p>

                        <p class="midsection__description"> We dicussed various ways for a user to add a card to their collection online. A couple of these ways include: 
                            <ul> 
                                <li> A "card" (i.e. dashed outline) within the flow of cards that prompts you to add a card by clicking on it. This would be placed either at the end of the cards of the beginning. </li> 
                                <li> A fixed button at the lower right corner of the screen, like Google Calendar and other applicaitons by Google. The user could click on this anytime they wanted as they scrolled through the cards. </li> 
                                <li> A button in the header of the page </li> 
                                <li> A menu bar for a set of operations on the website </li>

                        <p class="subsection__description"> I decided on a button in the header, so that where the user can add cards stays consistent. The dashed outline at the end of the collection would mean that the user would always have to browse to the end of their collection in order to add a card, and placing it at the beginning would take up more space on the page than what's needed. A button in the header is just clear as and is more conventional, so the user knows how to interact with the website in order to achieve their goal of adding a card. A fixed button in the lower right hand corner was a good option since the user would alwasys have an option to add a card no matter how far they've gone down the page, but it's not as obvious to the user since it's far from where a user will typically look on a website (upper left), and on mobile devices, it obscures the image of the card. Additionally, adding a card is an action that is typically found a menu, which is usually placed at the top of the page. </p>

This contrasts with another method where users handle the logistics at the time of uploading, so before uploading the picture, the user must title the picture, assign an album, etc. </p>
