                                <li> A fixed button at the lower right corner of the screen, like Google Calendar and other applicaitons by Google. The user could click on this anytime they wanted as they scrolled through the cards. </li> 
                                <li> A button in the header of the page. </li>

                        <p> There were a few ideas for the layout of this page. One was similar to Flickr's whole page upload, where the user can drag in or click to upload several pictures into the window, and in the following screen, you are allowed to decide the logistics for each of the photos you've just uploaded including name, description, and album. This contrasts with another method where users handle the logistics at the time of uploading, so before uploading the picture, the user must title the picture, assign an album, etc. CardKive is meant for cards, and cards typically focus on two parts, the front and the back. There's really no need for the user to upload more than two photos, so in order to make things simpler and remain consistent, we have two upload containers, one for the front, and another for the interior of the card. Once the user uploads both, we can </p>

                <p> CardKive is for people who receive lots of cards for many different occassions, but aren't able to enjoy them. These cards end up on boxes and stored away in the attic. Storing these cards in a place on your phone that's easily accessible allows them to enjoy these cards whenever they want. It was found that the typical user for this type of application are females ages twenty to forty. </p> 
                <p> While most of website is done, this project is still in progress, and there are aspects of the website that are likely to change. But, you can view the website as it is now at <a href="http://www.mycardkive.com"> mycardkive.com</a>.</p> 
                <div class="midsection"> 
                    <div class="header"> 
                        <h3> Infographic </h3> 
                        <p> These are the final images that we decided to use for the website. We got rid of the unclear abstraction of uploading photos, and older usb connection way of uploading, and replaced it with a more modern approach of uploading, i.e. to the cloud. CardKive is aimed at younger people, so this kind of graphic is more current and trendy. And the last graphic makes it clear, that CardKive can be used on both desktops and your mobile devices, while previous drafts of the design only represented a phone. This was a result of a misunderstanding of the product and where the founders of CardKive wanted to go with it. I was under the impression that CardKive was focused on the mobile application rather than the desktop, but they really wanted it to be accessible to people everywhere, since memories happen everywhere. </p> 
                        <p> Another aspect of the design includes the "gradient" effect from the first step to the last. Aside from the numbering, we wanted the steps to be clear, so there's a subtle gradient effect applied to the pictures where the first picture is lighter than the next, and so on. </p>
