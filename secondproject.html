                <p> Store sales are ubiquitous but not efficiently communicated. We recognized the cluttering of our virtual mailboxes with e-mails from countless stores, and set out to develop Salehound, a web application that would resolve that issue. </p>

Salehound allows the customer to have control over what they see from the store and when they see it.</p>

                        <p> We researched and gathered ideas for Salehound from applications that we use in our daily lives. One of the main things we learned from this was that we wanted to focus on customizability and a lot of user control of what they wanted to see.  </p>

                        <p> Even when email services like Gmail separate promotional emails from personal ones, it is still difficult to search through all the promotional emails for what an individual wants. We want to use this problem as inspiration for change. </p>

                        <p> Reddit is an inspiration because of its customizability. We like that Reddit allows users to subscribe to different subreddits thus changing their experience with the website over time. Users can find which subreddits they enjoy and can ignore others. This builds a user’s relationship with the website. </p>

                        <p>Pinterest is an inspiration because of its organizational properties. Pinterest provides users the ability to organize items and ideas into their own categories. We like the customizability of the categories. We feel that it allows users the ability to tailor the site to their specific needs.</p>

                        <p> We like the notification system that RetailMeNot uses. They notify users if they have coupons that will expire soon through a push notification. We could possibly use something similar for sales. </p>

                        <h2> Shop Kick </h2>
                        <p> We like Shop Kick because of how it provides items from different companies and gives you more coupons if you shop at a certain store. This allows the app to be personalized without direct user input because the app changes based on what the user buys through the app. </p>

                        <h3> Heuristic Evaluation </h3>
                        <p> After creating prototypes for Salehound, we did some allowed users to test them and evaluate them based on Neilsen's ten heuristics. These are the results and what we took into consideration for the next steps in designing and developing Salehound. </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li> No ability to save individual offers 
                            <p>The stores can be saved to a favorites area, but the individual sales/promotions/offers could not be saved. This is a problem with <b>recognition rather than recall</b> as it  presents a challenge for users to retrieve the sales they are interested in. A good example of a solution for this can be seen in the Google Offers app. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li> No back button
                            <p>There is no way to go back after navigating or expanding store offers. This is a <b>user control and freedom problem</b>. No page has a back button right now, and the solution is to add one to every page. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li> No sorting/organizing content 
                            <p>The minimalistic screen is good and clear. It’s easy to see all the items and know what’s going on. However, when more stores are added to the list on Prototype 1 or 2, only ~3 stores or sales can be seen at once. This can be a challenge to scroll through so many items. There should be a way to filter and/or sort the content. This is a violation of <b>flexibility and efficiency of use</b>. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li> No display/notification of expiration dates on offers 
                            <p>Another issue with <b>recognition rather than recall</b> is that the expiration dates on sales are not shown. Users should be able to see the expiration dates possibly be notified when a sale or offer is about to expire. The expired offers should be removed from the sales and offers page so users do not accidentally use them. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li> Not all of the pages have an indicator/header
                            <p>Users can’t see what page they’re on (whether they’re viewing stores or the home page, etc). This violates recognition rather than recall/<b>visibility of system status</b>/<b>consistency and standards</b>. The solution is to add headers to each page. </p>

                        <p> For our A/B testing, we chose to offer an alternative homepage—one that had more of a grid like screen and one that required more scrolling, like a feed. We tracked the watch button on the sales and compared the number of clicks between the two different home pages. Altogether, we gathered 29 people to test our web application. It seemed like a lot of people had trouble starting, often asking what they should do. Some people suggested a landing page when you first visit the page to tell you what to do. It may not be entirely clear to people what the application is for. It seems like a large amount of people would just view the application rather than interacting with the buttons. It may also be the case that they do not want to commit to watching a sale at first glance as one person mentioned that they did not want to track the sale. </p>

                        <p> Based on the Chi-Squared analysis of the A/B testing results, it seems like there is most likely no significant difference between using the grid design and the feed design in terms of user preference. This was the case both with respect to mobile and computer interfaces and overall without looking at such data. </p>

                <p> The theme of our studio was "to improve how relevant information is brought to us as we move about in daily life, this includes both determining what new information can be useful as well as creating intuitive ways of presenting this information to users." Nowadays, information is ubiquitous, but we don't have streamlined ways to bring all this information to people in ways that is organized so that the information is easily absorbed and understood. Our application started when one of our teammates noticed that his e-mail was cluttered with so many offers from different stores. And these e-mails not only advertise sales, but new products, stores opening, etc. With so much clutter, I can't find what I'm usually looking for-discounts and sales. Salehound allows you to personalize the sales you look at based on the stores you select. You can unsubscribe and subscribe easily from these stores, in case you ever change your mind rather going through the sometimes cumbersome process of unsubscribing from store e-mails. Additionally, you can easily search for specific stores and view the deals being offered from that particular store. Our application also lets you keep track of offers, allowing you easy access to expiration dates of coupons and end dates for ongoing sales. Our application organizes all this information available and presents it in a way that is easily accessed. </p>

                <h2 class="title">- Lessons Learned -</h2> 
                <p>We've made several changes to this project so far in order to streamline the user's interactive process. We've changed the language and presentation so that it is more intuitive to the user. She or he won't have to guess what the button they are clicking on will do. This is a result of our heuristic evaluations received. By demoing prototypes to people outside our group, we found make user-related confusions and improved upon it. For example, we used to only have an icon with a shopping bag on it, but users found it unintuitive to click on it to go to "My Stores". Additionally, making prototypes helped out better streamline the process, because we were more aware of the flow of the application as we created each page. It was helpful to realize what would work and what wouldn't work. Additionally, because we worked on the prototypes as a team, we were all able present our ideas and integrate them into one main idea once we provided each other with feedback. All these tools that we've been learning have helped us design and redesign our project so that it is better utilized by the average user. </p>
